# IndiespringTest

Apologies I didn't finish; I had AS issues and had to reinstall it during development, and now i'm out of time.
I was almost ready to make the Bitcoin details API call when navigating to said Activity from clicking a list item.
* Once that was done I'd have added some unit tests to confirm the bitcoin items were sorted as requested.
* I added a 2 min task of a swipe to refresh feature in case the data didn't load, so you didn't need to close the app and reopen. This didn't eat into any time at all.
* Some Espresso tests would have been nice using Mock data and classes.
Thanks,
Jon
